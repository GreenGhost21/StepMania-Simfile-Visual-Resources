# BG Scripts

Scripts assume that the video sets are in their own respective folders inside the RandomMovies folder. 

BGScript folder hierarchy goes in order of:
1. Simfile Category (`Arcade` or `Microsoft Xbox`, as examples)
2. Simfile Source (The dropdown on ZIv that takes you to the game's simfile group. Could also be a folder of user-made simfiles)
3. Simfile Name
4. `.ssc` with the `#BGCHANGES`/`#FGCHANGES` included, with the name formatted as `SONG NAME — [Script Source or Author] {Video Set}`.

My `UNIVERSE` Script for `Nightshade (Diskowarp Easily Amused Mix)` would, for example, be:

```
Microsoft Xbox 360\DanceDanceRevolution UNIVERSE\Nightshade (Diskowarp Easily Amused Mix) — [Official UNIVERSE2] {UNIVERSE2}.ssc
```

Another example from the first post on the [BG Scripts thread](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/thread?threadid=4519) would be:

```
Arcade\DanceDanceRevolution SuperNOVA\LOGICAL DASH — [Official DDRMAX2 JP CS] {MAX-EXTREME}
```

This hierarchy ought to be sufficiently clear and distinct for most cases.

Pull requests would also work for contributions, but those tend to be for advanced users of GitHub.
