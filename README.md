# The BG Scripts/Resources Repository
A repository for StepMania BG Scripts and resources for BG Script Creation

## Initial video setup instructions:
1. [Download the folders of videos from this link](https://mega.nz/folder/UXJG2LhB#qjBnF5iABvS5gSaHuTk21Q). If space is a concern, only download the video sets you need.
2. Put the *entire folders* into your RandomMovies folder. **Do ***NOT*** take the videos out of their folders.** The final structure needs to be:

```StepMania\RandomMovies\[Video Folder]\[Videos]```

## Script installation instructions:
1. Download the latest version of the simfile from the ZIv website to ensure compatibility.
2. Download one of the `.ssc` files for the song from this repository.
   - Most songs only have one. If a song has multiple, pick *only one*. 
3. Put the `.ssc` file in the respective song folder
4. Boot StepMania and try the song.

If everything is done correctly, you should have background animations playing during the song.

## A note about the MAX-EXTREME folder

I included a MAX-EXTREME folder for Beware's videos, despite most people putting Beware's videos directly into their RandomMovies folder. It's OK to have both, but I did this for consistency with the other video sets. In the long term, I would like to update Beware's scripts to use this format, as well as have compatibility with the ZIv versions of the songs.
